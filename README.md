# Test-Driven Development with Clean Architecture

This repository is based on [Reso Coder's](https://github.com/ResoCoder) awesome TDD Clean Architecture Course, which you can see by [clicking here](https://resocoder.com/2019/08/27/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-1-explanation-project-structure/).

Since the tutorial was made in 2019, a lot of things changed. Now the new versions of flutter are null safety, what made some of the old versions' code deprecated. Additionally some of the libraries used on the original tutorial were discontinued, like the [Data Connection Checker](https://pub.dev/packages/data_connection_checker).

While going through the tutorial, I've updated some of the old code to make it work on the new versions of flutter. Some library choices were made, like the [Mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) in favor of [Mocktail](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail) due to it making testing with null safety work closer to what's in the tutorial without the need to generate more complicated code.

I'm gonna provide a more detailed explanation of the changes later on.
